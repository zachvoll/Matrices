csim.c - a LRU cache simulator that replays traces from Valgridn and outputs stats (hits, misses, evictions). \n
trans.c - contains a matrix wavefront function that attempts to minimize misses for specific sizes (32 sets and 256 sets). \n
matrix_xor.ys - takes xor of two matrices between 1-8 NxN sizes, somewhat optimized.
